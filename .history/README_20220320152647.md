# Code Quiz

## Description
Worked on by Vincent Shepard

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- Then a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock 
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score

## Changes that were made
- Provided a concise title.
- integrated a dynamic start button that when clicked initiates the quiz
- Built the HTML framework, JavaScript functions, and CSS style sheets using tools I learned from past assignments 
- Updated the selectAnswer buttons to tell when a user chose a correct/incorrect answer
- Set up an array and function that randomizes the quiz questions as well as lets you proceed to the next question
- Set up a Timer that runs once the start button is clicked
- Made it so that when an incorrect answer was chosen using a JS function there was a penalization of 5 seconds
- Created an end screen, which was reached when all questions were answered or the timer hit zero
- Created a section on the end screen to input initials as well as save your high score
- Created a separate HTML and JS file for the score section which could be referenced to by pressing the high score button 
- Created and flushed out the README.




## Tools used
